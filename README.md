Chess Solver:
Design:
Designed a java program where in for a given chess piece and its position the program outputs the possible position for the piece to move to.
Implementation:
Implemented the chess board using an 2D array
Used HashMap to store the position of already placed chess piece on the board and referred to it in order to factor an answer for the next piece movement. Another Hashmap was used to record the empty positions and provide the choice to the user. On receiving the input from the user the position of the piece is updated.


Balanced Binary Search Tree:
Design:
Created a Balanced Binary Search Tree from the input entered in the console.
Every time an Input String is entered, the input is added to the BST and BST is updated to make it balanced and when an element is deleted the tree is be updated to make it balanced. The BST is so designed to check if its a max heap or not. The Anagram count for each input string in BST can aslo be determined.


Directed Graph(Algorithm and DataStructures/Java)
Designed a java program to create a directed graph using the inputs for the console.The program also finds the shortest path from the source to all the vertices in the graph using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.


Gourmet Recipe Book(JavaScript/Node.js/MongoDB)
Designed an interactive and a dynamic web application which enables the users to login and retrieve recipes.Its a web application with MVC pattern that is built using Node.js and MongoDB ,the application security is also implemented through input validation and authentication.The project uses EJS template pages for the presentation, routes for the controller and the business logic is defined using JavaScript objects. The front end web pages is designed using HTML5 and CSS3. The project has a session for each user wherein the user can add new recipes,retrieve saved recipes,provide feedback, rate and delete recipes.The retrieved data from each session user is updated in MongoDB.

Developed the application to allow the user to retrieve news regarding various categories like sports, technology etc. Designed the app to displays the news content along with the corresponding images.The JSON file containing the news object is retrieved through the api and is parsed to extract the news articles in an Async class, where the news articles is stored in an arraylist. The arraylist is looped over to display the news onto the display screen.


Email Application (Android | Mobile Application | Java)
Designed an E-mail Application by using OkHttp and Shared Preferences. Implemented user sign-in and sign up through API calls. Enabled the user to compose mails ,access their inbox and display the received mails.

This application uses a URL that retrieves a text file containing a dictionary of keywords and image URLs related to the associated keyword.The application consists of a single activity that enables the user to download and view online photos. 


Student Profile Builder Application(Android | Mobile Application | Java)
The application enables a new student to enter and edit their information, and save it using shared preferences

Data Management in Iot for Weather Monitoring System(Android Mobile Application/ C)
The purpose of the project is to design and develop a weather monitoring system which
can be used for monitoring of physical parameters in an industry.Designed an embedded board with various sensors along with an SST processor and an GSM module. The processor is responsible for processing the sensor reading values and transmitting it to the GSM module which later transmits this data to the android mobile application. The application is designed to provide alerts based on the sensor readings received. The application also maintains a log of all the sensor reading values. In case of an safety emergency the application is designed to notify the nearby police and fire station.
