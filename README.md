Chess Solver:
Design:
Designed a java program where in for a given chess piece and its position the program outputs the possible position for the piece to move to.
Implementation:
Implemented the chess board using an 2D array
Used HashMap to store the position of already placed chess piece on the board and referred to it in order to factor an answer for the next piece movement. Another Hashmap was used to record the empty positions and provide the choice to the user. On receiving the input from the user the position of the piece is updated.


Balanced Binary Search Tree:
Design:
Created a Balanced Binary Search Tree from the input entered in the console.
Every time an Input String is entered, the input is added to the BST and BST is updated to make it balanced and when an element is deleted the tree is be updated to make it balanced. The BST is so designed to check if its a max heap or not. The Anagram count for each input string in BST can aslo be determined.
